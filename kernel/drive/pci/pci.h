    0x00        Vendor ID      |       Device ID            [READONLY]VENDOR ID is the name of the producer of the device of which DEVICE ID is the name
    0x04        Command        |       Status               Command provides control over a device's ability to generate and respond to PCI cycles. 
                                                            Where the only functionality guaranteed to be supported by all devices is, 
                                                            when a 0 is written to this register, the device is disconnected from the PCI bus for all accesses except Configuration Space access. 
                                                            Status is a register used to record status information for PCI bus related events. 
    0x08    Revision | Prog IF | Subclass | Class Code      [READONLY]Revision ID records the version of PCIE while Class Code records it's category
                                                            [READONLY]Class Code is a read-only register that specifies the type of function the device performs. 
                                                            [READONLY]Subclass is a read-only register that specifies the specific function the device performs. 
                                                            [READONLY]Prog IF(Programming Interface Byte) is a read-only register that specifies a register-level programming interface the device has, if it has any at all. 
    0x0c    Cacheline| Latency |  Header  |     BIST        [READONLY]Header Type: bits 7 determines whether this device is multifunctional or of a single function
               Size  |  Timer  |   Type   |                                        bits 0-6 determines the type of this configuration space
                                                            BIST represents that status and allows control of a devices BIST (built-in self test). 
                                                            Latency Timer specifies the latency timer in units of PCI bus clocks. 
                                                            Cacheline Size specifies the system cache line size in 32-bit units. A device can limit the number of cacheline sizes it can support, 
                                                            if a unsupported value is written to this field, the device will behave as if a value of 0 was written. 
    0x10           Base Address Register 0
    0x14           Base Address Register 1                  BAR stores the base addr of the space this PCI device uses after reseted
    0x18           Base Address Register 2                  pay attention that the addr is PCI bus addr but memory offset
    0x1c           Base Address Register 3                  every device can owns no more than 6 base addr spaces
    0x20           Base Address Register 4                  but few devices use all of the six spaces
    0x24           Base Address Register 5                  A practical way to get the length of the space this device used is to read from the reg after write 0xffffffff
